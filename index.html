				<p>
					ProtoNet is a network prototyping tool aiming to make the network configuration process easier, more efficient, and more reliable for users like you!
					This program offers a range of tools to help create and edit the layout of your network. And by following the security guidance offered by ProtoNet, you
					can build a stronger foundation on which to build your network.
				</p>
				<h2>Getting Started</h2>
				<p>
					The Network Configuration page is where network layouts are generated. When entering this page, you will be greeted by a form to help you get started.
					You can enter hardware requirements for your desired network here and select your preference between a secure or efficient configuration. From there,
					ProtoNet can generate a network layout to fit your requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternatively, you can exit out of the form to start from scratch and build a custom network design. ProtoNet offers the tools needed to easily design and
					display network configurations.
				</p>
				<p>Clicking the "Change Configuration" button in the bottom left corner of the page will bring the form back up again, allowing you to regenerate a 
				configuration at any time.</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Generated network layouts use symbols to represent different types of nodes of the network. The table below lists the types of nodes that can be
					included in configurations generated by ProtoNet, as well as the symbols that represent them.
				</p>
				<table style="width:20%">
					<tr>
						<th>Type</th>
						<th>Symbol</th>
						<th>Abbreviation</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Server</td>
						<td><img src="img/square.png" width="20" height="20"></td>
						<td>SE</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Switch/Router</td>
						<td><img src="img/triangle.png" width="20" height="20"></td>
						<td>SW</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Firewall</td>
						<td><img src="img/hexagon.png" width="20" height="20"></td>
						<td>FW</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Workstation</td>
						<td><img src="img/circle.png" width="20" height="20"></td>
						<td>WS</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br />
				<p>Connections between these nodes are represented by lines. </p>
				<br />
				<h2>Additional Information</h2>
				<p>The Security Information page provides a detailed description of how ProtoNet generates secure configurations. This includes the guidelines that
				ProtoNet's secure configurations follow and the concepts behind them. </p>
